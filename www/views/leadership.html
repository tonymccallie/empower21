            <h1>Letter from Ossie Mills</h1>
            <p>Our desire through Jerusalem 2015 is to be an open vessel to allow the Holy Spirit to touch the lives of millions around the world.</p>

            <p>According to James 5:16, “The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” It is our desire that you would use this tool over the next few months, weeks and days to focus your prayers on the Kingdom effectiveness of this event.</p>

            <p>Thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours in travel and countless man hours of work, planning and preparation will have been invested into the Jerusalem 2015. Without the hand of the Lord on this event, it will be a nice trip to the Holy Land, but it will not be the life-changing, Spirit-encountering milestone that we know God wants it to be.</p>

            <p>Please band together in prayer to cover every aspect of the Jerusalem 2015 let’s pray believing that our difference-making, heart-felt prayers profit much! To the Glory of God!</p>

            <p>Yours in Kingdom work,<br />
            <b>Ossie Mills<br />

            <h1>Letter From Dennis Lindsay</h1>
            <p>Two of Christ For The Nations foundational pillars are prayer and the love for Israel. These two pillars have been significant in the growth and existence of the ministry. We know that without these two vital foundational supports, CFN would have little spiritual impact on transforming the lives of individuals. For this reason, Christ For The Nations has linked its ministry with Oral Roberts University in promoting the Empowerment 21 Global Congress to be held in Jerusalem May 20-25, 2015. Therefore, we invite you to participate in this great event, both in prayer and attendance. We believe your participation will make a difference in the lives of the Jewish and Arab believers, as well as the Benjamin (Joseph’s youngest son) generation, who I believe represents the youth of the world. In my opinion, God will use the Benjamin Generation in bringing back the Lord of the Harvests, the Messiah to the world. Will you pray and plan to attend Empowerment 21 Global Congress in Jerusalem on Pentecost Sunday 2015?</p>

            <h1>Letter From CFN Prayer Team</h1>
            <p>Oral Roberts University and Christ For The Nations have preserved a decades-long partnership in like-faith and Holy Spirit-empowered training. We are delighted to continue that long-lasting relationship by coupling in prayer for the Empowered21 Jerusalem Congress in 2015. This prayer guide is a one-year, daily investment for Kingdom advancement of the Spirit-empowered movement. It is a prayerful countdown to see a new wave of awakening draw near to the Body of Christ worldwide.</p>

            <p>The book of Hebrews explains that we first see in the spiritual realm before things are actualized in the physical realm. With this prayer guide we are declaring the vision in order to bring it to pass. This booklet is a compilation of prayer for: the global leadership of the Empowered21 movement; the core team of Empowered21; the Jerusalem 2015 Congress; the regional council of nations represented; the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; the Spirit-empowered church movement; the fluidity of generations; the impact of the living and active Word of God reviving the hearts of men; and the spiritual warfare that rages in all these arenas.</p>

            <p>As you join with us in declaring appeals to Heaven, we know that you will receive the first-fruit rewards of those requests. It is our desire that you will experience a personal awakening in your life, as you join us in prayer and speak the declarations of God’s Word throughout this booklet.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking up the call to pray for Empowered21 Jerusalem 2015.</p>
