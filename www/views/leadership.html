            <h1>Letter from Billy Wilson</h1>
            <p>During the Empowered21 2015 Global Congress we will join with thousands of believers from around the globe to renew our commitment to be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth. We will unite to leave a residual blessing in the Holy Land, and pray for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit on a new generation.</p>
            <p>As we embark upon this exciting journey to the Holy Land prayer is of the utmost importance. The Bible states in Mark 11:24 “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you will receive them, and you will have them.” As a community of believers, we ask you to join us each day as we pray for the 2015 Global Congress. </p>
            <p>The entire Global Council would like to thank you for joining us in prayer for this Kingdom event. May the Lord bless you and I hope to see you in Jerusalem!</p>
            <p><i>Making No Little Plans,</i></p>
            <p>Dr. Billy Wilson<br />Empowered21 President and Global Chair</p>
            <p><br /></p>

            <h1>Letter From Dennis Lindsay</h1>
            <p>Two of Christ For The Nations foundational pillars are prayer and the love for Israel. These two pillars have been significant in the growth and existence of the ministry. We know that without these two vital foundational supports, CFN would have little spiritual impact on transforming the lives of individuals. For this reason, Christ For The Nations has linked its ministry with Oral Roberts University in promoting the Empowerment 21 Global Congress to be held in Jerusalem May 20-25, 2015. Therefore, we invite you to participate in this great event, both in prayer and attendance. We believe your participation will make a difference in the lives of the Jewish and Arab believers, as well as the Benjamin (Joseph’s youngest son) generation, who I believe represents the youth of the world. In my opinion, God will use the Benjamin Generation in bringing back the Lord of the Harvests, the Messiah to the world. Will you pray and plan to attend Empowerment 21 Global Congress in Jerusalem on Pentecost Sunday 2015?</p>

            <h1>Letter From CFN Prayer Team</h1>
            <p>Oral Roberts University and Christ For The Nations have preserved a decades-long partnership in like-faith and Holy Spirit-empowered training. We are delighted to continue that long-lasting relationship by coupling in prayer for the Empowered21 Jerusalem Congress in 2015. This prayer guide is a one-year, daily investment for Kingdom advancement of the Spirit-empowered movement. It is a prayerful countdown to see a new wave of awakening draw near to the Body of Christ worldwide.</p>

            <p>The book of Hebrews explains that we first see in the spiritual realm before things are actualized in the physical realm. With this prayer guide we are declaring the vision in order to bring it to pass. This booklet is a compilation of prayer for: the global leadership of the Empowered21 movement; the core team of Empowered21; the Jerusalem 2015 Congress; the regional council of nations represented; the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; the Spirit-empowered church movement; the fluidity of generations; the impact of the living and active Word of God reviving the hearts of men; and the spiritual warfare that rages in all these arenas.</p>

            <p>As you join with us in declaring appeals to Heaven, we know that you will receive the first-fruit rewards of those requests. It is our desire that you will experience a personal awakening in your life, as you join us in prayer and speak the declarations of God’s Word throughout this booklet.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking up the call to pray for Empowered21 Jerusalem 2015.</p>
